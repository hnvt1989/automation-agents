# Log Deletion Fix Summary

## Problem
When deleting a log entry, the wrong log was being deleted. This was caused by an index mismatch between the frontend display order and the backend deletion logic.

## Root Cause
1. The GET `/logs` endpoint sorts logs by date in reverse order (newest first) before returning them
2. The DELETE `/logs/{log_index}` endpoint was processing logs in the order they appear in the YAML file
3. This mismatch meant the index from the frontend didn't correspond to the correct log in the backend

## Solution
Updated both DELETE and PUT endpoints for logs to sort the logs by date (newest first) before processing, matching the GET endpoint's behavior:

```python
# Sort by date (newest first) to match GET /logs endpoint
flat_logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)
```

## Files Modified
1. `/src/api_server.py`:
   - Line 484: Added sorting to DELETE `/logs/{log_index}` endpoint
   - Line 524: Added sorting to PUT `/logs/{log_index}` endpoint

2. `/tests/integration/test_delete_functionality.py`:
   - Updated test expectations to match the new sorting behavior

## Testing
- Created comprehensive tests in `test_log_deletion_fix.py` to verify correct deletion order
- Updated existing tests to match the new behavior
- All 21 tests now pass (17 original + 4 new)

## Impact
- Log deletion now works correctly - the log you click to delete is the one that gets deleted
- Log updates also work correctly with the same consistent ordering
- No breaking changes to the API interface
