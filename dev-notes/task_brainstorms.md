## Brainstorm: Document 686c/674 form update test scenarios in TestRail (106264)

**Generated:** 2025-06-03 16:07:21
**Type:** initial

### Overview
The task involves documenting end-to-end test scenarios for the 686c/674 forms in TestRail. This documentation will facilitate the creation of test runs for various project milestones, enabling consistent and reliable test executions by team members.

### Key Considerations
- Ensure compatibility with existing testing frameworks such as RSpec and VCR.
- Align test scenarios with project milestones for timely validation.
- Maintain consistency with previously established test documentation standards.
- Secure and manage shared credentials efficiently to avoid access issues.
- Facilitate clear communication within the team for shared understanding of test cases.

### Potential Approaches
- Adopt a modular approach in documenting test scenarios to simplify updates and maintenance.
- Leverage the in-progress example as a template to speed up development and ensure compliance with standards.
- Conduct a review session with stakeholders to validate test scenario completeness prior to final submission.
- Integrate feedback loops from initial test runs to iterate on and improve scenario documentation.

### Risks and Challenges
- Potential delays in securing shared team credentials, impacting timeline adherence.
- Misalignment of test scenarios with actual use cases, leading to inefficiencies in testing.
- Challenges in maintaining test data integrity across different test iterations.

### Recommendations
- Request shared team credentials from the Platform Team using established protocols and document timelines for follow-up.
- Map out test scenarios in alignment with known project milestones and prioritize by impact and complexity.
- Utilize VCR cassettes to ensure stable test environments and simulate realistic interactions.
- Schedule regular check-ins with the team to discuss progress and address issues promptly.
- Conduct a thorough review of documented test scenarios with relevant team members before finalizing and entering them into TestRail.

### RAG Context Used
- ** Discusses various tests including those for the form 686c, mentioning the use of VCR cassettes to simulate interactions and the testing framework utilized (RSpec and VCR).
