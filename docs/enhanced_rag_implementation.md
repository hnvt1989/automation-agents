# Enhanced RAG Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented enhanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality with multiple search strategies and context ranking for improved brainstorming quality.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Multiple Search Strategies
The system now generates diverse search queries using different strategies:

- **Direct Title Search**: Uses the full task title
- **Tags + Title**: Combines tags with title for category-aware search
- **Key Terms Extraction**: Extracts meaningful words, removing stop words
- **Objective-Based Search**: Uses the task objective if available
- **Subtask Search**: Searches based on subtasks (limited to prevent overload)
- **Combined Concepts**: Merges key terms from title and objective

### 2. Context Ranking and Relevance Scoring

Implemented sophisticated relevance scoring that considers:

- **Title Term Matching** (50% weight): How many task title terms appear in content
- **Tag Matching** (40% weight): Presence of task tags in content
- **Objective Matching** (30% weight): Alignment with task objectives
- **Exact Phrase Bonus** (+20%): Full title appears in content
- **Related Terms** (+5% each): Synonyms and related concepts
- **General Relevance** (+15%): Domain-specific terms with task relevance

### 3. Context Deduplication

- **Similarity Detection**: Uses sequence matching to identify similar content
- **Score-Based Selection**: Keeps highest-scoring version of similar content
- **Configurable Threshold**: Default 70% similarity for deduplication

### 4. Enhanced Integration

The brainstorming system now:
1. Generates multiple search queries from task information
2. Retrieves contexts using each query strategy
3. Deduplicates similar results
4. Ranks contexts by relevance to the specific task
5. Uses top-ranked contexts for brainstorming
6. Tracks relevance scores in source attribution

## Code Structure

### New Module: `src/agents/enhanced_rag.py`
Contains all enhanced RAG functionality:
- `extract_key_terms()`: Removes stop words and extracts meaningful terms
- `generate_search_queries()`: Creates diverse search queries
- `calculate_similarity()`: Measures text similarity for deduplication
- `deduplicate_contexts()`: Removes duplicate contexts
- `calculate_relevance_score()`: Scores content relevance to task
- `rank_contexts_by_relevance()`: Ranks contexts by combined scores
- `get_enhanced_rag_context()`: Main function for enhanced retrieval

### Updated: `src/agents/task_brainstorm.py`
- Integrated `get_enhanced_rag_context()` for better retrieval
- Updated source tracking to include relevance scores
- Added fallback to basic search if enhanced fails

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/unit/test_enhanced_rag.py`:
- Tests for key term extraction
- Tests for search query generation
- Tests for relevance scoring
- Tests for context deduplication
- Tests for ranking algorithms
- Integration tests with brainstorming

## Usage Example

When brainstorming task "Explore weekly Automated Test coverage Sync to TestRail":

1. **Generated Queries**:
   - "Explore weekly Automated Test coverage Sync to TestRail"
   - "testing integration Explore weekly Automated Test coverage Sync to TestRail"
   - "explore weekly automated test coverage sync testrail"
   - "Integrate test coverage reports with TestRail weekly"

2. **Retrieved Contexts** (ranked by relevance):
   - TestRail API documentation (relevance: 0.90)
   - Integration patterns guide (relevance: 0.80)
   - Automation scheduling guide (relevance: 0.70)

3. **Result**: More accurate and comprehensive brainstorming with relevant context

## Performance Considerations

- **Query Limit**: Maximum 5 queries per brainstorm to prevent API overload
- **Result Limit**: 3 results per query for efficiency
- **Context Limit**: Top 5 contexts used for brainstorming
- **Caching**: Consider implementing caching for repeated queries (future improvement)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Semantic Search**: Use embeddings for semantic similarity
2. **Query Optimization**: Learn which strategies work best for different task types
3. **Feedback Loop**: Track which contexts lead to better brainstorms
4. **Performance Caching**: Cache query results for common searches
