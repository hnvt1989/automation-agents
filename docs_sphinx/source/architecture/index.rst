Architecture Overview
--------------------

The Multi-Agent Automation System is built using modern software architecture principles:

**üèóÔ∏è Layered Architecture**
   - **User Interface Layer**: Rich CLI with interactive features
   - **Orchestration Layer**: Primary agent with intelligent delegation
   - **Agent Layer**: Specialized agents for specific domains
   - **Integration Layer**: MCP servers for external services
   - **Storage Layer**: Vector database and file-based storage

**üîÑ Event-Driven Design**
   - Asynchronous agent communication
   - Non-blocking external service calls
   - Reactive error handling and recovery

**üß© Modular Components**
   - Loosely coupled agent implementations
   - Pluggable MCP server architecture
   - Configurable storage backends

**üìä Data-Driven Intelligence**
   - Vector embeddings for semantic search
   - Machine learning for query understanding
   - Contextual information retrieval

Key Design Principles
--------------------

**Single Responsibility**
   Each agent has a focused, well-defined purpose

**Dependency Injection**
   Components receive dependencies through injection for testability

**Error Isolation**
   Failed components don't cascade failures to the entire system

**Configuration-Driven**
   Behavior is controlled through configuration rather than code changes

**Extensibility**
   New agents and MCP servers can be added without core changes

Technology Stack
---------------

**Core Language**
   - Python 3.8+ with type hints
   - Async/await for concurrency

**AI Framework**
   - PydanticAI for agent implementation
   - OpenAI API for language models
   - ChromaDB for vector storage

**External Integration**
   - Model Context Protocol (MCP)
   - Node.js-based MCP servers
   - RESTful API integrations

**User Interface**
   - Rich library for CLI
   - Markdown rendering
   - Interactive prompts

C4 Model Diagrams
-----------------

The system architecture is documented using the C4 model:

- **Level 1 - System Context**: :doc:`c4_diagrams` shows external interactions
- **Level 2 - Container**: Details internal system containers
- **Level 3 - Component**: Deep dive into component relationships

Design Patterns
---------------

See :doc:`design_patterns` for detailed information on:

- **Delegation Pattern**: Primary agent routing
- **Registry Pattern**: Agent and server management
- **Strategy Pattern**: Flexible processing approaches
- **Factory Pattern**: Component instantiation
- **Observer Pattern**: Event handling and logging

Data Flow
---------

The :doc:`data_flow` section covers:

- Request processing flow
- Agent communication patterns
- Data persistence strategies
- Error propagation mechanisms

Security Considerations
----------------------

Security aspects are detailed in :doc:`security`:

- API key management
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling without information leakage
- Secure file operations
