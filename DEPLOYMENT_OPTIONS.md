# Deployment Options for Automation Agents

This document analyzes deployment options for the PydanticAI-based automation agents application, considering the constraint that ChromaDB is too large for serverless deployments like Vercel.

## Application Architecture Summary

**Core Components:**
- **Backend**: FastAPI with PydanticAI multi-agent system
- **Frontend**: HTML-based SPA with inline React and WebSocket connectivity
- **Storage**: ChromaDB (vector database), YAML files, Markdown files, optional Neo4j
- **MCP Integration**: Node.js-based servers (GitHub, Slack, filesystem, search)
- **External APIs**: OpenAI, Brave Search, GitHub, Slack

**Key Requirements:**
- Persistent storage for ChromaDB and file system
- Both Python and Node.js runtime environments
- WebSocket support for real-time chat
- Environment variable management for API keys
- File system access for document management

- ✅ Managed vector database reduces operational overhead
- ✅ Better scalability and performance for vector operations
- ✅ Can use serverless for parts of the application
- ✅ Professional backup and disaster recovery

#### Cons:
- ❌ Significant code changes required to migrate from ChromaDB
- ❌ Higher ongoing costs for managed services
- ❌ Vendor lock-in concerns
- ❌ Additional complexity in data synchronization

#### Option B: External ChromaDB + Application Server
- **Storage**: Dedicated VPS/VM just for ChromaDB
- **Compute**: Separate server for application logic
- **Connection**: Network connection between services

#### Pros:
- ✅ Can optimize each server for its specific workload
- ✅ Independent scaling of storage and compute
- ✅ Minimal code changes required

#### Cons:
- ❌ Increased networking complexity and latency
- ❌ More servers to manage and secure
- ❌ Additional costs for multiple servers
- ❌ Potential security issues with network connections

## Conclusion

For most use cases, a **cloud VPS (DigitalOcean, AWS EC2, or Google Compute Engine)** offers the best balance of:
- Cost effectiveness
- Performance for ChromaDB
- Flexibility and control
- Ease of deployment
- Scalability options

The containerized approach with Docker Compose provides excellent deployment consistency and makes future migrations easier.

For teams preferring managed solutions, **Railway** offers good value with less operational overhead, though storage costs should be monitored carefully as ChromaDB grows.

The key is to start simple with a VPS deployment, then optimize based on actual usage patterns and requirements.
