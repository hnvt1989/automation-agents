# Overview  
[Design and develop AI-driven agents for quality assurance (QA) to boost overall productivity. 
Our objective is to build intelligent agents capable of generating code and tests, creating QA metrics dashboards, 
and automatically logging defects from pipeline failures, along with other efficiency-enhancing tasks]

# Core Features  
[List and describe the main features of your product. For each feature, include:
- Multi-Agents orchestration.
- AI-driven agents for quality assurance (QA) to boost overall productivity.
- Tests Generation Agent (TGA), Test execution Agent (TEA), Test Analysis Agent (TAA), QA Metrics dashboard Agent (MDA), Defect Logging Agent (DLA).
- TGA generate test scripts by using Gerkin syntax and Playwright DOM snapshot, artifacts generated by TGA will send to TEA.
  TEA execute the tests, artifacts send to TAA
  TAA analyzes the test results, send metrics to MDA
  MDA agent logs the defect and notify slack channel.

# Technical Architecture  
[Outline the technical implementation details:
- System components
- Data models
- APIs and integrations
- Infrastructure requirements]

# Development Roadmap  
[Break down the development process into phases:
- MVP requirements
- Future enhancements
- Do not think about timelines whatsoever -- all that matters is scope and detailing exactly what needs to be build in each phase so it can later be cut up into tasks]

# Logical Dependency Chain
[Define the logical order of development:
- Which features need to be built first (foundation)
- Getting as quickly as possible to something usable/visible front end that works
- Properly pacing and scoping each feature so it is atomic but can also be built upon and improved as development approaches]

# Risks and Mitigations  
[Identify potential risks and how they'll be addressed:
- Technical challenges
- Figuring out the MVP that we can build upon
- Resource constraints]

# Appendix  
[Include any additional information:
- Research findings
- Technical specifications]
