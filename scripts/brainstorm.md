# AI-Driven QA Agent Development Plan

## 🎯 Objective
Design and build intelligent QA agents that can:
- Auto-generate test code and scripts
- Create QA metrics dashboards
- Automatically log defects from CI/CD pipeline failures
- Perform other productivity-enhancing QA tasks

---

## ⚠️ Assumptions to Re-examine
- AI-generated tests are accurate, maintainable, and context-aware
- Failure logs are informative enough for automatic triage
- AI can generate useful dashboards without domain-specific logic
- Productivity gains outweigh complexity and false positives

---

## 🛠️ Phase-Based Execution Plan

### 🔹 Phase 1: Foundational Infrastructure
- Identify QA artifacts: test cases, bug reports, pipeline logs, etc.
- Set up data ingestion (GitHub, Jenkins, Jira)
- Choose agent orchestration framework: LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI
- Define success metrics (coverage, defect triage accuracy)

### 🔹 Phase 2: Test Code Generation Agent
- Input: user stories, API specs, code diffs
- Generate unit/integration/E2E tests
- Use LLM + prompt tuning
- Output to GitHub PR comments for human review

### 🔹 Phase 3: Pipeline Failure Triage Bot
- Parse build logs and tracebacks
- Classify root causes (infra vs test vs code)
- Auto-create Jira tickets with enriched context

### 🔹 Phase 4: QA Metrics Agent
- Extract data from test runs, coverage reports
- Generate insights (“flaky tests up 30%”, etc.)
- Build dashboards in Grafana/Metabase
- Include NL summaries

### 🔹 Phase 5: Agent Autonomy + Chaining
- Agents collaborate:
  - TestGen → Runner → Analyzer → TriageBot
- Define orchestration, roles, and memory
- Build feedback loops and fallback paths

## 📌 Milestone Deliverables

| Milestone | Deliverable |
|----------|-------------|
| M1 | Data pipeline + architecture scaffold |
| M2 | Test generation agent w/ review interface |
| M3 | Failure triage bot integrated to CI |
| M4 | Metrics dashboard and insights agent |
| M5 | Multi-agent loop w/ partial autonomy |

---

## 🔍 Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Countermeasure |
|------|----------------|
| Hallucinated test cases | Human-in-loop review |
| Incomplete diagnostics | Fallback to manual triage |
| Data privacy issues | Redact logs or use synthetic data |
| Lack of trust in agents | Transparency, changelogs, reversibility |

---

## ✅ Next Steps
- Finalize which framework to use for orchestration (LangGraph vs AutoGen vs CrewAI)
- Begin with Phase 1: pipeline ingestion and observability
- Build agent-by-agent with milestone validations
