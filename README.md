# Automation Agents

## Overview
Design and develop AI-driven agents for quality assurance (QA) to boost overall productivity. Our objective is to build intelligent agents capable of generating code and tests, creating QA metrics dashboards, and automatically logging defects from pipeline failures, along with other efficiency-enhancing tasks.

## Core Features
- **Multi-Agents orchestration**
- **AI-driven agents for quality assurance (QA) to boost overall productivity**
- **Tests Generation Agent (TGA), Test Execution Agent (TEA), Test Analysis Agent (TAA), QA Metrics Dashboard Agent (MDA), Defect Logging Agent (DLA)**
- **TGA**: Generates test scripts using Gherkin syntax and Playwright DOM snapshot. Artifacts generated by TGA are sent to TEA.
- **TEA**: Executes the tests; artifacts are sent to TAA.
- **TAA**: Analyzes the test results and sends metrics to MDA.
- **MDA**: Logs the defect and notifies the Slack channel.


example prompt: 

create a test using the <resources> at <directory> , create a pull request.
if this pull request is approved. run the following pipeline steps:

run the test at <directory>
collect the metrics, post to dashboard
post to slack bot
