# React Frontend

This is a simple React application powered by Vite. It provides a chat window with a message input and a file attachment icon so users can include files with their messages.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the development server
- `npm run build` – build for production
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build

The chat interface is implemented in `src/App.jsx` and styled with `src/App.css`.
