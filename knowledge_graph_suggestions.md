# Knowledge Graph Implementation Plan for Automation Agents RAG System

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a strategic plan to enhance the current vector-based RAG system with knowledge graph capabilities, enabling semantic relationships, entity modeling, and more sophisticated querying while preserving the existing ChromaDB infrastructure.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing RAG System Strengths
- **Solid Foundation**: ChromaDB with OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-small)
- **Advanced Chunking**: Sophisticated contextual chunking with LLM-generated context prefixes
- **Rich Metadata**: Comprehensive metadata schema with source tracking, timestamps, content analysis
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Modular design with specialized agents (RAG, Planner, Filesystem, etc.)
- **Web Processing Pipeline**: Robust crawler with title/summary extraction and embedding generation

### Current Limitations for Knowledge Graph Enhancement
- **Pure Similarity Search**: Limited to vector similarity without relationship modeling
- **No Entity Recognition**: Missing entity extraction and relationship mapping
- **Flat Knowledge Structure**: No hierarchical or graph-based knowledge representation
- **Limited Query Capabilities**: Cannot answer questions requiring multi-hop reasoning or relationship traversal

## Knowledge Graph Benefits for Your System

### Enhanced Query Capabilities
1. **Relationship-Based Search**: "Find all documents related to Python frameworks used for web crawling"
2. **Multi-Hop Reasoning**: "What technologies are connected to AsyncWebCrawler through ChromaDB?"
3. **Entity-Centric Views**: "Show all concepts, tools, and relationships around OpenAI integration"
4. **Temporal Relationships**: "How have the dependencies of this project evolved over time?"

### Dynamic Knowledge Management
- **Automatic Entity Extraction**: From your rich metadata and content
- **Relationship Discovery**: Between technologies, concepts, and documents
- **Knowledge Evolution Tracking**: As your automation agents process new information
- **Context-Aware Retrieval**: Leveraging both vector similarity AND semantic relationships

## Recommended Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Hybrid Vector-Graph Foundation (2-3 weeks)

#### Technology Stack Addition
```python
# New dependencies to add to requirements.txt
networkx>=3.0           # In-memory graph operations
spacy>=3.7.0           # NLP entity extraction
spacy[transformers]     # Advanced NLP models
neo4j>=5.0             # Optional: Advanced graph database
rdflib>=7.0            # RDF/semantic web support (lightweight option)
```

#### Architecture Integration
1. **Maintain ChromaDB** as primary vector store
2. **Add NetworkX** for in-memory graph operations
3. **Extend existing metadata** to include extracted entities and relationships
4. **Create hybrid retrieval** combining vector similarity + graph traversal

#### Entity Extraction Pipeline
```python
# New processor: src/processors/entity_extractor.py
class EntityExtractor:
    """Extract entities and relationships from processed chunks."""
    
    def extract_entities(self, text: str, metadata: Dict) -> List[Entity]:
        """Extract entities from chunk content using spaCy + custom rules."""
        
    def extract_relationships(self, entities: List[Entity], text: str) -> List[Relationship]:
        """Identify relationships between entities in the same document."""
        
    def build_document_graph(self, chunks: List[ProcessedChunk]) -> NetworkXGraph:
        """Build document-level knowledge graph."""
```

### Phase 2: Graph-Enhanced RAG Agent (2-3 weeks)

#### Enhanced RAG Agent Tools
```python
# Extended RAG agent with graph capabilities
@self.agent.tool
async def search_knowledge_graph(
    ctx: RunContext[RAGAgentDeps], 
    query: str, 
    search_type: str = "hybrid",  # "vector", "graph", "hybrid"
    relationship_depth: int = 2
) -> str:
    """Search using both vector similarity and graph relationships."""

@self.agent.tool  
async def explore_entity_relationships(
    ctx: RunContext[RAGAgentDeps],
    entity_name: str,
    relationship_types: List[str] = None
) -> str:
    """Find all entities and documents related to a specific entity."""

@self.agent.tool
async def find_knowledge_paths(
    ctx: RunContext[RAGAgentDeps],
    start_entity: str,
    end_entity: str,
    max_hops: int = 3
) -> str:
    """Find connection paths between two entities through the knowledge graph."""
```

#### Storage Schema Enhancement
```python
# Extended ChromaDB metadata schema
enhanced_metadata = {
    # Existing fields...
    "source_type": "web_page_contextualized",
    "url": chunk.url,
    # New knowledge graph fields
    "extracted_entities": ["Python", "ChromaDB", "OpenAI", "AsyncWebCrawler"],
    "entity_types": ["TECHNOLOGY", "LIBRARY", "API", "FRAMEWORK"],
    "relationships": [
        {"source": "Python", "relation": "USES", "target": "ChromaDB"},
        {"source": "AsyncWebCrawler", "relation": "INTEGRATES_WITH", "target": "ChromaDB"}
    ],
    "graph_centrality_score": 0.85,  # How central this document is in the knowledge graph
    "entity_density": 0.23  # Entity density for document importance
}
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Graph Analytics (2-3 weeks)

#### Knowledge Graph Analytics Agent
```python
# New agent: src/agents/knowledge_graph.py
class KnowledgeGraphAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Specialized agent for knowledge graph analysis and insights."""
    
    async def analyze_knowledge_clusters(self) -> str:
        """Identify knowledge clusters and topic areas."""
        
    async def find_knowledge_gaps(self) -> str:
        """Identify poorly connected or missing knowledge areas."""
        
    async def suggest_content_relationships(self) -> str:
        """Suggest new content to improve knowledge connectivity."""
        
    async def generate_knowledge_summary(self, topic: str) -> str:
        """Generate comprehensive topic summaries using graph traversal."""
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Graph Storage Strategy

#### Option A: Lightweight (Recommended for Medium Project)
```python
# In-memory graph with ChromaDB persistence
class HybridKnowledgeStore:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vector_store = get_chromadb_client()  # Existing
        self.graph = nx.MultiDiGraph()  # New in-memory graph
        self.entity_index = {}  # Fast entity lookup
        
    def add_document_with_graph(self, chunk: ProcessedChunk, entities: List[Entity]):
        # Store in ChromaDB (existing)
        self.vector_store.add_documents([chunk.content], [chunk.metadata], [chunk.id])
        
        # Store in graph
        for entity in entities:
            self.graph.add_node(entity.name, type=entity.type, **entity.attributes)
            self.entity_index[entity.name] = chunk.id
```

#### Option B: Full Graph Database (For Future Scaling)
```python
# Neo4j integration for advanced graph operations
class Neo4jKnowledgeStore:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vector_store = get_chromadb_client()  # Keep existing
        self.graph_db = neo4j.GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(user, password))
        
    def cypher_search(self, query: str) -> List[Dict]:
        """Execute Cypher queries for complex graph operations."""
```

### Entity Extraction Strategy

#### Technology-Aware Entity Recognition
```python
# Custom entity patterns for your automation agents domain
DOMAIN_PATTERNS = {
    "TECHNOLOGY": ["ChromaDB", "OpenAI", "pydantic-ai", "AsyncWebCrawler"],
    "PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE": ["Python", "JavaScript", "TypeScript"],
    "FRAMEWORK": ["FastAPI", "Flask", "React", "Playwright"],
    "CONCEPT": ["RAG", "embedding", "vector search", "automation agent"],
    "FILE_TYPE": [".py", ".md", ".json", ".yaml"],
    "API": ["OpenAI API", "Brave Search API", "GitHub API"]
}

class DomainAwareEntityExtractor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
        self.domain_patterns = DOMAIN_PATTERNS
        
    def extract_domain_entities(self, text: str) -> List[Entity]:
        """Extract entities relevant to automation/development domain."""
```

### Integration with Existing Crawler

#### Enhanced Processing Pipeline
```python
# Modified process_chunk function in crawler.py
async def process_chunk_with_graph(
    original_chunk_content: str, 
    chunk_idx: int, 
    url: str, 
    whole_page_text: str,
    entity_extractor: EntityExtractor
) -> ProcessedChunkWithGraph:
    
    # Existing processing...
    processed_chunk = await process_chunk(original_chunk_content, chunk_idx, url, whole_page_text)
    
    # New graph processing
    entities = entity_extractor.extract_entities(processed_chunk.content, processed_chunk.metadata)
    relationships = entity_extractor.extract_relationships(entities, processed_chunk.content)
    
    # Enhanced metadata
    processed_chunk.metadata.update({
        "extracted_entities": [e.name for e in entities],
        "entity_types": [e.type for e in entities],
        "relationships": [r.to_dict() for r in relationships]
    })
    
    return ProcessedChunkWithGraph(
        **processed_chunk.__dict__,
        entities=entities,
        relationships=relationships
    )
```

## Performance Considerations

### Query Performance Strategy
1. **Vector-First Filtering**: Use ChromaDB for initial candidate retrieval
2. **Graph-Based Re-ranking**: Apply graph relationships to improve relevance
3. **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed graph paths and entity relationships
4. **Incremental Updates**: Update graph incrementally as new content is processed

### Memory Management
```python
# Efficient graph operations for medium-scale data
class OptimizedGraphOperations:
    def __init__(self, max_graph_size: int = 100000):
        self.max_nodes = max_graph_size
        self.lru_cache = {}  # Cache for frequent graph queries
        
    def prune_graph_if_needed(self):
        """Remove least important nodes if graph grows too large."""
        
    def cache_common_paths(self):
        """Pre-compute and cache common relationship paths."""
```
